## _This mod is still a work in progress (WIP)! Expect changes and some bugs._

Construct additional input/output ports for fluids and items on any machine! The ports snap onto the sides of machines.

- Add more outputs to overclocked miners and machines so that you can extract all produced items
- For machines with multiple outputs, select what items are allowed to leave what ports

**Multiplayer supported** as of 0.2.0

Please leave suggestions and report issues on the [Nog's Mods Discord](http://discord.gg/zqp6U7Y7Nu).

## Notes

- When building belts/pipes to these ports, if they would normally clip with the building's clearace, the clearance check is disabled.
